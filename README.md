### Approach
Using the box method, design the code part by part
I.E. framing the code using classes, implement, then debug (repeat)
Use the skeleton given by the starter code and expand
Implemented bit by bit, as recommended in the project directions

### Challenges
- data(self, message) function gave us some trouble
- finding routes was difficult

### Testing
Debugged each part using the VSCode Python debug with command line arguments
Debugged by using the print function
